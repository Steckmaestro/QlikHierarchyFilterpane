# QlikHierarchyFilterpane
An extension for Qlik sense to generate a hierarchy filterpane

Special thanks to @rvspt (https://github.com/rvspt/D3DynamicTreeLayout-QS)
His hierarchy extension for Qlik Sense was my starting point and I used some of his code to generate the node tree recursively.

Here you can see how it looks in action.

Configuration is very similar to rvspt's hierarchy extension I did however add an auto expand level function.

This is the demo hierarchy table i used to test my extension (also included in the demo app)
